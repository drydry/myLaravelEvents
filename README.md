# myLaravelEvents (Laravel & AngularJS)

myLaravelEvents is a website allowing users to share events and participate.
The back-end is based on RESTFUL api calls + MySQL database and the front-end on AngularJS:
  - Authentication process (register, login, logout)
  - List of all events/hosted events only
  - Event creation, update, delete
  - Book events.

The app is very basic for now(no validation, some parts are still missing) but the foundation is pretty solid.
